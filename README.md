# spanningSeeds
Number of output sequences from a fibonacci linear feedback shift register whose feedback polynomial coefficients (excluding the constant term) correspond to the binary representation of n
Can be thought of as a Pseudorandom number generator algorithm - Determine the number of seeds needed to reach every possible generated number for a given taps, or set of taps

# Background on random numbers 
pseudorandom numbers can be generated by a computer in the following way: 
A tap is chosen (any positive integer)
Another positive integer (a seed) is chosen as the first random number with the same number of bits in its binary representation as the tap
The next number is generated by eliminating the highest bit of the seed, moving all the other bits over to the right by one, and making the first bit
the dot product of the binary representations of the taps and the seed (mod 2). Every further number is generated by the same process, but instead of the seed,
using the last generated random number
Ex. set tap to 5, and seed to 3. So tap = [1 0 1] in binary and seed = [1 1 0]. So next number is 7 ([1 1 1], and then 6 [0 1 1]
